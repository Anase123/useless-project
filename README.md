### Project Description
This web app analyses a photo of an egg. The photo can either be uploaded, or taken at the moment using a camera.
The analyzer then seems to analyze the image, but then generates a random number as symmetry value since, you know, 
Machine Learning is hard. Real Hard.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Really wanted to see how symmetric an egg is.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Wrote a program to check how symmetric an egg is (Totally Valid).
