        <h2>Call of Duty: Potato Warfare</h2>
        <p>
          In this groundbreaking FPS, you are not a soldier‚Ä¶ you are a potato.
          Survive the kitchen battlefield against evil forks and butter knives
          while upgrading your armor with mashed potato skins. Critics call it
          ‚Äúcrispy and intense.‚Äù

        <h2>Mario Kart: Office Chair Edition</h2>
        <p>
          Race your coworkers down the office hallway in swivel chairs. Collect
          coffee cups for speed boosts, avoid paperclip traps, and drift around
          the water cooler. HR says it‚Äôs dangerous; we call it fun.

        <p>
          Play as Grandma Mildred, causing chaos in the suburbs. Steal mobility
          scooters, throw knitting needles at enemies, and bake explosive pies.

        <h2>Cyberpunk 2077.2: Now with 20% More Bugs</h2>
        <p>
          Experience the glitchiest game ever intentionally made. Walls
          disappear, cars fly into the sky, and NPCs walk backwards while
          insulting you in binary code. It‚Äôs broken, but that‚Äôs the point.

        <h2>Fortnite: Hide and Seek Edition</h2>
        <p>
          Instead of building and shooting, the entire match is just one giant
          hide-and-seek game‚Ä¶ in a map the size of the planet. Rounds can last
          up to 6 real-life days. Winner gets a free banana skin.
